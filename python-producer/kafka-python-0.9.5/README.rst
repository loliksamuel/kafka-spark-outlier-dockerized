This module provides low-level protocol support for Apache Kafka as well as
high-level consumer and producer classes. Request batching is supported by the
protocol as well as broker-aware request routing. Gzip and Snappy compression
is also supported for message sets.

Coordinated Consumer Group support is under development - see Issue #38.
